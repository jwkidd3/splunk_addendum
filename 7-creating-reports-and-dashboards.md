## Creating Reports and Dashboards
---
* When you create a search or a pivot you want to run again or share with others, you can save it as a report. 
* This means that you can create reports from both the Search and the Pivot sides of the Splunk platform.
* Reports are saved searches
* They can show events, statistics, or visuals
* Running reports returns a fresh result each time
* Statistics and Visualizations allow you to drill down by default to the underlying event data

### Once you create a report you can:
---
* View the results that the report returns on the report viewing page. You can get to the viewing page for a report by clicking the name of the report on the Reports listing page.
* Open the report and edit it so that it returns different data or displays its data in a different manner. 
* Your report opens in either Pivot or Search, depending on how it was created.

### In addition, if your permissions enable you to do so, you can:
----
* Change the report permissions to share it with other Splunk users. See Set report permissions, in this manual.
* Schedule the report so that it runs on a regular interval. Scheduled reports can perform actions each time they run 
* Accelerate slow-completing reports built in Search. 
* Embed scheduled reports in external websites. 
* Add the report to a dashboard as a dashboard panel. 

#### Smart Naming Conventions
* It's important to go with your organizations naming conventions for things
* If you do not have one, define one
`<group>_<object>_<description>`
`csuit_report_balanceOfaccounts`

### Creating a Report from a Search
----
You can create reports via Splunk Web four ways:
    * From Search, by saving a search as a report.
    * From Pivot, by saving a pivot as a report.
    * By selecting Settings > Searches, reports, and alerts and clicking New Report to add a new report.
    * From a dashboard, by converting an inline-search-powered dashboard panel to a report.

* Run any search you would like and select the `Save As` button and then select  `Report`
* Give the report a meaningful title
* Specify a description
* Select a time range to include or not. ( adding the picker will allow you to adjust the time when you run the report next )
* You can change the Additional Settings down at the bottom of the wizard once the report is created.

### Preview your saved search
----
* You can preview a search before running it by using search expansion. 
* Search expansion allows you to preview your search by expanding the entire search, including saved searches, without running the search.

**Steps**
1. Navigate to the Splunk Search page.
2. In the Search bar, type the default report`Errors in the last 24 hours`
3. Open search expansion by using the keyboard shortcut `Command-Shift-E` (Mac OSX) or `Control-Shift-E` (Linux or Windows).
4. The search expansion preview shows syntax highlighting and line numbers, if those features are turned on. 


### Running Reports
* Click the `Reports` tab and the name of the report you would like to run. 
* Use the time range picker to change the time of the report to run it. 

### Editing Reports
If you want to edit a report's definition, are two ways, whether you're on the Reports listing page or looking at the report itself.

**If you're on the Reports listing page** locate the report you want to edit, go to the Actions column, and click Open in Search or Open in Pivot 

**If you've entered the report to review its results** click Edit and select Open in Search or Open in Pivot 

### Edit the definition of a report opened in Search
----
* After you open a report in search, you can change the search string, time range, or report formatting. 
* After you rerun the report, a Save button will be enabled towards the upper right of the report. Click this to save the report. 
* You also have the option of saving your edited search as a new report.

### Edit the definition of a report opened in Pivot
----
* Edit the definition of the pivot: 
    * add, remove, or redefine filters, split rows, split columns, or column values. 
    * You can also change the way the pivot results are formatted (change the visualization type, or fix the way a chart displays). 
    * When you are done, click Save at the upper right of the page to save your report. You also have the option of saving your edited pivot as a new report.

#### To edit a report's description, permissions, schedule, and acceleration settings
----
* From the Reports listing page, or from the report viewing page. Click Edit and choose:
1. Edit Description to change the name and description of the report.
2. Edit Permissions to change the report permissions. 
3. Edit Schedule to schedule the report or change the report schedule if it already has one. 
4. Edit Acceleration to change the way the report is accelerated. Note: This option is only available for certain kinds of reports created in Search. 

**Note: You can't perform these actions if you've opened the report in Search or Pivot. Save the report or return to the Reports listing page if you want to edit these aspects of the report.**

#### Use the Advanced Edit page to update a report configuration
 ----
 * If your role enables it, you can edit the full configuration of a report with the Advanced Edit page. The Advanced Edit page exposes a large variety of configuration settings for reports.
**Steps**
1. Select Settings > Searches, Reports, and Alerts.
2. Find a report that you want to edit and select Edit > Advanced Edit.
3. Update the report configuration as necessary.
4. Save your changes

### Creating Tables of Visualizations
Three Main Methods of creating tables and visuals:
1. Selcet a field from the fields sidebar and choose a report to run.
2. Use the Pivot interface ( start with a dataset or a pivot )
3. Using SPL to transform the results into what you want.


### Viewing Tables and Visuals
----
**Data and formatting requirements**

* Use specific search commands to generate results in the correct format; search using transforming commands, such as `stats`, `chart,` `timechart`, or `geostats` to render.

* Depending on the chart type or complexity, the number and ordering of data series can vary.

* Single value and gauge visualizations represent a single numerical value.

* Maps combine a query and other data components, data with coordinates or place information, lookup definitions, and geographical markup files.
Basic table making
`index = _internal | chart avg(bytes) over sourcetype`
or
`index = _internal | stats count by action, host`
Change the way the columns appear with table
`index = _internal | stats count by action, host | table host count`

### Using the statistics table
* `Statistics` tab using Splunk's built ins for visuals or tables
* The number and order of Statistics table columns show you the data structure that a search generated. 
* * Creating a report from the field window  selecting a field and then choosing the type of report that appears in the window
* For text,you can create a Top Values Report the same way.
* A bar chart is the default visual, with the option to change to many other splunk built in charts or formats. 
  * Stack series, change X-Y Orientations, overlay other charts on top of each other, format a legend, and stack colors
* Statistics tab will change the reults to a table
* Data overlays allow you to create a heatmap and highlight max/min values visually

#### Simple XML
----
* Dashboards use Simple XML source code to define their content and behavior. 
* You can use the dashboard editor in Splunk Web to edit this source code.
* The editor provides validation, error messaging, and warnings as you make changes.
* Keyboard shortcuts consistent with Ace code editor shortcuts are available in the dashboard editor.

* You can format Simple XML source code using `Command + Shift + F` on a Mac or `CTRL + Shift + F` on Windows.

#### Developer options
----
* Splunk Enterprise users can implement additional dashboard customizations:
  * Extend Simple XML using CSS and JavaScript.
  * Convert a Simple XML dashboard to HTML and use JavaScript to implement customizations including inputs and REST API access.
  
### Create a dashboard
----
* Dashboards are created in the context of a particular app. 
    * For example, if you are using the Search and Reporting app, dashboards use this app context.
* After you create a dashboard, you can modify its permissions to share or manage access for other users. You can also modify the app context.
