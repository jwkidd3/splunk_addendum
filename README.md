##### Notes:
-----
*   team background ETL Development mostly done on SQL
*   loading batch files from clients to Data warehouse
*   currently using splunk ( FTP logs, system event logs ) -> Other potentials ( logins -> whose logged in but not badged in? )
*   Gain more expertise with the tool ( Alerting and Responding ) -> Cron jobs examples for running and reacting to events
*   Alerting and Monitoring Production Events
*   Digital Books  ( ensure private hosting of materials; `zip` )
